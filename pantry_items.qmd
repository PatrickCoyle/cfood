# Pantry Items

A lot of diets will have you dramatically cut one thing or another. For me, it was a lot easier to replace stuff with healthier alternatives. Here are some examples:

-   **Crunchy snacks**

    -   Bad: potato chips, Cheez-Its

    -   Better:

        -   Popcorn with no butter, light butter, or olive oil (low calorie but not nutritious/filling);

        -   Nuts, Wheat Thins (high calorie but nutritious/filling).

-   **Meat**

    -   Bad: beef

    -   OK: chicken, plant-based meat

        -   Plant-based meat replacements have gotten much tastier and are a great option for vegetarians. However, they can be high in saturated fat and sodium. So these are not necessarily the best options for weight loss / cholesterol reduction / heart health -- although they are still healthier than beef. Your mileage may vary. Always check the nutrition facts on plant-based ingredients, rather than assuming they are healthy.

    -   Better: turkey, fish, mushrooms, eggplant
